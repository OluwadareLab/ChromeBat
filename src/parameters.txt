######### Parameters for GenomeBat algorithm ##################

#A .log and .pdb will be produced with this name
output_file=bat

### Algorithm Parameters ###

#which version of optimization to use
#1 is default and is the vectorized implementation
#2 is the iterative version(slow!)
#PSO uses vectorized vanilla particle swarm from wikipedia


#alpha is the conversion factor used to convert the contact matrix into a Distance matrix
#the formula for distance d based on contact rate c is d(c)=1/(c^alpha)
#alpha=0.5

#num_bats is how many bats the algo should simulate
#it appears to impact runtime linearly, that is doubling the amount of bats will double the runtime
num_bats=10

#generations is how many iterations of the algorithm will run
#also impacts runtime linearly
generations=10000

### Bat Behavioral Variables ###

#Bounds determine the boundaries of the search space
#I.e. if upper_bound=1 and lower_bound=0 the bats will find a solution within the unit cube
upper_bound=10
lower_bound=0

#a bats frequency determines how aggressively it optimizes
#A bat with high frequency will fly toward the best known solution at high speed
min_freq=0
max_freq=0.1

#A bats volume determines how willing it is to accept a new solution
#A value of 0 means a bat will always never accept new solution and 1 means it always will
volume=0.9

#A bat's pulse rate determines how often it stops exploring and teleports to the current best known solution
#a pulse rate of 1 means it always appears at the best known solution
#a pulse rate of 0 means it never teleports 
pulse=0.9

perturbation=0.0075

structs=2
